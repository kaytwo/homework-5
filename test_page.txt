You’ll find a resolve.py file in your repo. This file contains code that approximates the functionality of the host program. The program takes a domain name, and returns a summary of DNS information about the domain. For example, given the domain “yahoo.com”, host returns the “A”, “AAAA” and “MX” records for the domain. You can test this out by running the resolve.py command as so: python resolve.py yahoo.com.
